Problem:

Jobseekers can sometimes falsify information on their CVs to appear more experienced than they actually are, leading recruiters to make hiring decisions based on inaccurate or exaggerated work histories. This practice not only undermines trust in the hiring process but also poses risks to companies that rely on genuine expertise. To address this, there is a need for a global platform where recruiters can access verified, blockchain-based data on jobseekersâ€™ work experiences. By providing an immutable and transparent record of employment history, such a platform ensures that recruiters have access to trustworthy information, ultimately creating a fairer and more reliable hiring process.

Proof of Work is a decentralized platform that allows jobseekers to securely share verified work history with recruiters, using blockchain technology. This project addresses the common issue of falsified experience by enabling only authorized companies to update and verify jobseekers' employment records. Recruiters gain access to trustworthy, tamper-proof work history, fostering a more transparent hiring process.
